# RandomCipherIdeas

Just some random ideas that I had for ciphers while researching encryption and playing around with math.

Also just some clones of existing ciphers.

I might add to it every now and then whenever I have an idea.

Originally written in Eclipse, so some stuff might need to be pulled out to make it IDE agnostic.
